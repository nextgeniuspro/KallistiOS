/** \file    dc/cdrom.h
    \brief   CD access to the GD-ROM drive.
    \ingroup gdrom

    This file contains the interface to the Dreamcast's GD-ROM drive. It is
    simply called cdrom.h and cdrom.c because, by design, you cannot directly
    use this code to read the high-density area of GD-ROMs. This is the way it
    always has been, and always will be.

    The way things are set up, as long as you're using fs_iso9660 to access the
    CD, it will automatically detect and react to disc changes for you.

    This file only facilitates reading raw sectors and doing other fairly low-
    level things with CDs. If you're looking for higher-level stuff, like
    normal file reading, consult with the stuff for the fs and for fs_iso9660.
